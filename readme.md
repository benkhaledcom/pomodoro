## Basic Pomodoro App

#### Coby Dev Notes
- I could split the CSS into different files
- Button hover/active animation is probably overkill
- Sound that plays when timer is up is quiet when ran for the first time
- UI is not very mobile friendly
- I was going to go with a stop-watch style for the timer
    - Maybe add a setting to change the timer style?

#### Further Project Ideas
- Make into full stack app
- Add sign in functionality
- Add ability to add friends and see their project progress
    - Accountability system
- ToDo list under timer, also visible to friends
